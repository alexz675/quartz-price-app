# Quartz Price Prediction App (Sanitized)

This repository contains a **Streamlit-based machine learning app** for predicting the unit price of quartz materials using historical inventory and specification data.

**Important: This repository uses sanitized code and fully fake/generated data. No confidential company information is included so you can't train a model, but you can still see how the logic works.**

---

## Features

- 📊 Interactive prediction app with dropdowns for product attributes
- 🧠 Model trainer using `HistGradientBoostingRegressor`
- 🔁 Undo functionality for parsed data uploads
- 🗂️ Cleaned and anonymized mapping system for quartz types, companies, and materials
- 🔐 Safe for public display or resume use

## File Overview

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `predictor.py` | The **Streamlit app** for users to predict the unit price of quartz using a trained model. Requires the fake parsed data and sanitized mapping file. |
| `modeltrain.py` | A **Streamlit app** for training the machine learning model. Parses uploaded inventory data, engineers features, trains the model, and logs performance. |
| `model_final.pkl` | A **trained model** file built using fake data. This model allows the app to work out of the box without requiring training. |
| `cleaned_mapping_file.xlsx` | Contains **anonymized mapping tables** for: <br/>• Quartz types → `Quartz Type Name` to `Quartz Type Code`<br/>• Company names → `Company X` to codes<br/>• Material names → `Material X` to codes |
| `fake_parsed_data.xlsx` | Fake but **structure-preserving parsed inventory data**. This mimics the real format but is completely randomized. |
| `fake_parsed_data_backup.xlsx` | Backup copy of the above, used by the app's undo function. |
| `model_training_log.csv` | Keeps track of trained models, including RMSE and R² performance. Uses fake training history. |

## Data Anonymization & Security

This repo follows strong sanitization practices:

- ✅ Company, material, and quartz type names are **fully replaced** with labels like `Company 1`, `Material 1`, etc.
- ✅ All values in Excel files (`parsed_data`, `backup`, etc.) are **randomized** but **parsable and realistic**.
- ✅ Serial numbers are retained in format for parsing, but randomized in content.
- ✅ No internal file paths or private business logic is exposed.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run either app:
    - Model Trainer:
      ```bash
      streamlit run modeltrain.py
      ```
    - Price Predictor:
